To run this locally make sure you install http-server using npm 
then on the command line run http-server [path to the index.html minus the actually "index.html"] and for even more good luck put the full path in double quotes.
THEN make sure you use either the second or 3rd out of
http://192.168.56.1:8080
http://192.168.40.82:8080
http://127.0.0.1:8080

since the first one didn't work. If that doesn't work though then definitely try the first one just to be sure.

# ThreeJS Bootstrap
Everything you need to start creating ThreeJS apps, with the added benefit of being able to deploy anywhere.

![The included sample scene, hi lobster](/Documentation/splash.jpg)

## Why use this?
This project was created to enable developers to quickly get started coding ideas in ThreeJS.  

It provides a lightweight ThreeJS dev environment without the need for NodeJS or NPM.
 
Projects created with this template have the benefit of being able to be deployed to any static web hosting provider (cheapest method!) 

Three JS dependencies are obtained via the unpkg CDN, as instructed in the [official documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation)

## How to use
1. Clone this project
2. Edit index.js
3. Deploy to a local server (VS Code's Live Server works well for local testing)
